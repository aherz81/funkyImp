Building the "langtools" workspace.

The "langtools" workspace can be built from the command line with Ant.
The build file is make/build.xml, in conjunction with make/build.properties.
Some additional user-specific properties files are also read, to allow
you to customize selected properties as needed.

Individual tools within the workspace can also be built and worked on
with NetBeans, using the projects in the make/netbeans directory.

The "langtools" workspace can also be built from the command line with
GNU Make, although the Makefile is simply a wrapper around the Ant
build file. This is provided for systems (such as the full OpenJDK build)
that expect to be able to build this workspace with GNU Make.

System Requirements:
  Ant:      version 1.6.5 or later
  NetBeans: version 6.0 or later (optional)
  JDK:      currently version 1.5.0, although 1.6.0 is recommended
  OS:       any system supporting the above tools
