README
created by Alexander Pöppl, July 2014

This directory was created as a container for the tools and data generated during creation of the Master's Thesis of Alexander Pöppl. There are a number of subfolders.

- AutomatedTest
	Holds a set of tools and script used to compare the predictions made by
	the runtime model with actual execution data. See the thesis for 
	details.

- BackupsCurFile
	There is a collection of files that can be used as a sample compilation
	unit that contains domains suitable to be compiled by the funkyIMP 
	compiler.

- Benchmarks
	This folder contains all the measurements that were taken in the course
	of the thesis. They may not necessarily reflect the most recent values.
	Benchmarks holding values made with the most current installation of the
	suite can be found in the subfolder "Final Measurements".

- BenchmarkSuite
	This folder contains the XCode/CMake project that implements the suite 
	of benchmarks used to obtain the model.

- Literature
	This folder contains a collection of the Literature used in the thesis,
	in PDF format.

- Pasted Misc
	This folder contains text dumps. Nothing to see here. Move along.

- ResultStatisticsGenerator
	This folder contains the NetBeans Project for the tool that evaluates
	how precise the prediction is for the different memory sizes. More or
	less deprecated.

- SampleCodegen
	This folder contains the NetBeans Project for the tool that generates
	random domain iterations.

- TestResultQualityCheck
	This folder contains the NetBeans project for the tool that evaluates
	how precise a prediction was for a certain benchmark.

- Thesis
	This folder holds the LaTeX source code of the thesis as well as the
	pdf output and a Makefile to build it from source.

- Utilities
	This folder contains an Objective-C application that can be used to
	parse the output of the compiler. Deprecated, and replaced by a shell
	script.
